/*
 * The following defines a type called ElementType that is a synonym
 * for string.  
 * 
 * In fact, none of the classes in this lab depend on the element
 * type. 
 * 
 * The right way to deal with this in C++ is to make the classes
 * *polymorphic* by using templates.  But we haven't learned about
 * those, so we have factored the element type out into this header
 * file, and each class can include it to find out what the element
 * type is.
 *
 * In principle, we could change the definition to another type, and
 * just recompile and relink for buffers, stacks, and queues of that
 * type. 
 *
 * File created and definition factored out by 
 * Mark A. Sheldon, Tufts University, 2020 Spring
