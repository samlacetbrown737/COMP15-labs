Lab 1
Comp 15
To complie: "make shop"
To run: "./shop bbq.txt"
Acknowledgments: The wonderful TAs in the 4:30-5:45 lab, and my friend Tyler for listening to me complain
Purpose: To maintain two lists, one of food that must still be bought and one of food which has already been bought.
Files submitted:
- bbq.txt: a list of foods needed for a BBQ, test input file
- README: this file
- Makefile
- main.cpp: Driver file which creates ArrayLists and uses their functioons
- ArrayList.cpp: Holds each ArrayList function
- ArrayList.h: defines ArrayList class and the scope of each function
Testing:
Checked the bbq.txt file before any editing, after adding new functions I would be
adding to the header file, after adding the expand/shrink functions, but before the resize 
one and after the resize function was completed.
Structures:
ArrayList/Vector, a dynamic array which allows for adding and removing items even after an
array is originally declared by copying the contents into a placeholder which is then
copied back into the same memory location but with more space allocated.
