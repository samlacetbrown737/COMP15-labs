This lab contains partial implementation of AVL Trees.

main.cpp         : Driver. Creates an AVL class object, and calls the 
                    insertion operation over a set of values.
AVLTree.cpp      : contains the methods to manipulate an avl tree.
AVLTree.h        : contains the interface of AVLTree class.
pretty_print.cpp : auxiliary file that contains the code to display a tree
                   tree is printed out graphically on the terminal
Makefile         : standard Makefile needed to compile the program.
README           : this file

In order to compile the program simply type 'make' in the console
You can execute it with './lab'

Note: the code is not complete on purpose.  Students must implement
some functions in AVLTree.cpp.

However, the code will properly compile and run without the missing
procedures --- it will work as a BST instead.
