 * AVL Tree Node:
 * - data is the value stored in the node
 * - height is the height of the node within the tree, increasing 
 *          from leaf up to the root.
 *
 * We're defining node struct outside the class, which is not good!
 * Node now available in the client's name space.  Our abstraction is
 * sound still, since we don't give the client access to Nodes, but
 * now the client can't use the name Node for anything!
 * This goes against the spirit of data abstraction.
 * We decided to do it this way because we are using a pretty printer Function
 * outside this class (complicated and indeepndent of the rest of the class). 
 * Keep in mind that this is a bad policy and not do it in your assignments
 * We will take deductions for abstraction violations when we assess
 * your submission.
