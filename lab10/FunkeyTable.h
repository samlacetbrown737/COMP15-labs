 * the song in beats per minute (bpm).  
 *
 * For the hash table, the song titles (strings) are keys and the
 * values are structs containing the chart position and the tempo.
 *
 * In a proper polymorphic (templated) hash table, this struct would 
 * be the value type and would be defined by the client independently
 * of the table.  The key type would be string.
 * 
 * Based on a previous hash table lab I think created by Ben Hescott.
